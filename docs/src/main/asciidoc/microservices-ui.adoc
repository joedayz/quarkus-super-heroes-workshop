[[microservices-ui]]
= User Interface

:icons: font

Now that we have the three main microservices, time to have a decent user interface to start fighting.
The purpose of this workshop is not to develop a web interface and learn _yet another web framework_.
This time you will just download an Angular application, install it, and run it on another Quarkus instance.

== The Web Application

Navigate to the `super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/ui-super-heroes` directory.
It contains the code of the microservice.
Being an Angular application, you will find a `package.json` file which defines all the needed dependencies.
Notice that there is a `pom.xml` file.
This is just a convenient way to install NodeJS and NPM so we can build the Angular application with Maven.
The `pom.xml` also allows us to package the Angular application into Quarkus.

If you are not in a _frontend mood_, just scroll to <<Installing the Web Application on Quarkus>>

== Looking at Some Code (optional)

You don't need to be an Angular expert, but there are some pieces of code that are worth looking at.
If you look under the `src/app/shared` directory, you will find an `api` and a `model` sub-directory.
Let's look at `fight.ts`.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/src/app/shared/model/fight.ts[tag=adocModel]
----

As you can see, it matches our `Fight` Java class.
Same for `fighters.ts`, `hero.ts` or `villain.ts`.
Under `api` there is the `fight.service.ts` that defines all the methods to access to our Fight REST API through HTTP.

[source,typescript,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/src/app/shared/api/fight.service.ts[tag=adocService]
----

Well, guess what?
We didn't have to type this code either.
It was generated thanks to a tool called `swagger-codegen`.footnote:[Swagger Codegen https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen]
Because our Fight REST API exposes an OpenAPI contract, `swagger-codegen` just swallows it, and generates the TypeScript code to access it.
It's just a matter of running:

[source,shell]
----
$ swagger-codegen generate -i http://localhost:8082/openapi -l typescript-angular -o src/app/shared
----

Here, you see another advantage of exposing an OpenAPI contract:
it documents the API which can be read by a human, or processed by tools.

== Installing the Web Application on Quarkus

Thanks to the `frontend-maven-plugin` plugin declared on the `pom.xml`, we can use a good old Maven command to install and build this Angular application.

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Execute `mvn install` and Maven will download and install Node JS and NPM and build the application.
You should now have a `node_modules` directory with all the Angular dependencies.
At this stage, make sure the following commands work:

[source,shell]
----
ng version (or ./node_modules/.bin/ng version)
node -v    (or ./node/node -v)
----

To install the Angular application into a Quarkus instance, we just build the app and copy the bundles under the `resources/META-INF/resources` directory.
Look at the `package.sh`, that's exactly what it does.

[source,shell]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/ui-super-heroes/package.sh[tag=adocShell]
----

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Execute the `package.sh` script.
You will see all the Javascript files under `resources/META-INF/resources` directory.
We are now ready to go.

[WARNING]
====
If the `ng` command does not work because it can't find `node`, there is a little hack to solve it.
Open the file `ui-super-heroes/node_modules/.bin/ng` and change the shebang line from `#!/usr/bin/env node` to `#!/usr/bin/env ./node/node`.
This way `ng` knows it has to use NodeJS installed under the `ui-super-heroes/node` directory
====

== Running the Web Application

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

As usual, use `mvn quarkus:dev` to start the web application.

Be sure you have the hero and villain microservices running (dev mode is enough).

Once the application is started, go to http://localhost:8080 (8080 is the default Quarkus port as we didn't change it in the `application.properties` this time).
It should display the main web page.

Oups, not working yet!
Not even the pictures, we must have been forgotten something!
Let's move on to the next section then and make the application work.
