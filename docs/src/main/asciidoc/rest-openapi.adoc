= Open API

:icons: font

By default, a Quarkus application exposes its API description through an OpenAPI specification.
Quarkus also lets you test it via a user-friendly UI named Swagger UI.

== Directory Structure

In this module we will add extra class (`HeroApplication`) to the Hero API project.
You will end-up with the following directory structure:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
super-heroes
+  rest-hero
++  src
+++  main
++++  java
+++++  io
++++++  quarkus
+++++++  workshop
++++++++  superheroes
+++++++++  hero
++++++++++  Hero.java
++++++++++  HeroApplication.java
++++++++++  HeroResource.java
++++++++++  HeroService.java
++  pom.xml
}
}

== Installing the OpenAPI Dependency

Quarkus proposes a `smallrye-openapi` extension compliant with the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI specification in order to generate your API OpenAPI v3 specification.footnote:[MicroProfile OpenAPI https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api]

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

To install the OpenAPI dependency, just run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="smallrye-openapi"
----

This will add the following dependency in the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/pom.xml[tags=adocDependencyOpenAPI]
----

== Open API

Now, you _curl_ `http://localhost:8083/openapi` endpoint:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8083/openapi
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/openapi-origin.yaml[]
----

This contract lacks of documentation.
The Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI allows you to customize the methods of your REST endpoint as well as the application.

=== Customizing Methods

The MicroProfile OpenAPI has a set of annotations to customize each REST endpoint method so the OpenAPI contract is richer and clearer for consumers:

* `@Operation`: Describes a single API operation on a path.
* `@APIResponse`: Corresponds to the OpenAPI Response model object which describes a single response from an API Operation
* `@Parameter`: The name of the parameter.
* `@RequestBody`: A brief description of the request body.

This is what the `HeroResource` endpoint looks like once annotated

include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroResource.java[tags=adocResource;adocOpenAPIImports;!adocMetrics;!adocMetricsImports]
----

=== Customizing the Application

The previous annotations allow you to customize the contract for a given REST Endpoint.
But it's also important to customize the entire application.
The Microprofile OpenAPI also has a set of annotation to do so.
The difference is that these annotations cannot be used on the Endpoint itself, but instead on another Java class configuring the entire application.

For this, you need to create the `src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroApplication` class with the following content:

[source]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/src/main/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroApplication.java[tags=adocApplication]
----

=== Customized Contract

If you go back to the `http://localhost:8083/openapi` endpoint you will see the following OpenAPI contract:

[source,yaml]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/openapi.yaml[]
----

== Swagger UI

When building APIs, developers want to test them quickly.
Swagger UI is a great tool permitting to visualize and interact with your APIs.footnote:[Swagger UI https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui]
The UI is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification.
The Quarkus `smallrye-openapi` extension comes with a swagger-ui extension embedding a properly configured Swagger UI page.
By default, Swagger UI is accessible at `/swagger-ui`.
So, once your application is started, you can go to `http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui` and play with your API.

You can visualize your API's operations and schemas.

For example, you can try the `/api/heroes/random` endpoint to retrieve a random hero.

== OpenAPI Tests in HeroResourceTest

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Let's add a few extra test methods in `HeroResourceTest` that would make sure OpenAPI and Swagger UI are packaged in the application:

[source,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/src/test/java/io/quarkus/workshop/superheroes/hero/HeroResourceTest.java[tags=adocOpenAPI]
----

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Execute the test using `./mvnw test`.
