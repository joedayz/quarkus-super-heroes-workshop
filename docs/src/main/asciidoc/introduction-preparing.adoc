= Preparing for the Workshop

:icons: font

This workshop needs internet access to download all sorts of Maven artifacts, Docker images and even pictures.
Some of these artifacts are large, and because we have to share internet connexions at the workshop, it is better to download them prior to the workshop.
Here are a few commands that you can execute before the workshop.

== Download the workshop scaffolding

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

First, download the zip file  {github-raw}/dist/quarkus-super-heroes-workshop.zip, and unzip it wherever you want.

In this workshop you will be developing an application dealing with Super Heroes (and Super Villains ðŸ¦¹) as well as Quarkus extensions.
The code will be separated into two different directories:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+ extensions           | The Quarkus extensions
+ super-heroes         | The entire Super Hero application
}
}
@endsalt
----

=== Super Heroes Application

Under the `super-heroes` directory you will find the entire Super Hero application spread throughout a set of subdirectories, each one containing a microservice or some tooling.
The final structure will be the following:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+ super-heroes
++ infrastructure          | All the needed infrastructure (Postgres, Kafka...)
++ event-statistics        | UI and application dealing with fight statistics (you will create it)
++ load-super-heroes       | Stress tool loading heroes, villains and fights
++ rest-fight              | REST API allowing super heroes to fight (you will create it)
++ rest-hero               | REST API for CRUD operations on Heroes (you will create it)
++ rest-villain            | REST API for CRUD operations on Villains
++ ui-super-heroes         | Angular application so we can fight visually
}
}
@endsalt
----

Most of theses subdirectories are Maven projects and follow the Maven directory structure:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+  super-heroes
++ rest-hero
+++ src
++++  main
+++++  docker
+++++  java
+++++  resources
++++  test
+++++  java
}
}
@endsalt
----

=== Quarkus Extensions

Under the `extensions` directory you will find quarkus extensions.
By the end of the workshop, you will get:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
quarkus-workshop-super-heroes
+  extensions
++  extension-banner           | Extension displaying a startup banner (you will create it)
++  extension-fault-injector   | Injects network latency and HTTP faults
}
}
@endsalt
----

== Checking Ports

During this workshop we will use several ports.

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Just make sure the following ports are free so you don't run into any conflicts

[source,shell]
----
$ lsof -i tcp:8080    // UI
$ lsof -i tcp:8082    // Fight REST API
$ lsof -i tcp:8083    // Hero REST API
$ lsof -i tcp:8084    // Villain REST API
$ lsof -i tcp:5432    // Postgres
$ lsof -i tcp:9090    // Prometheus
$ lsof -i tcp:2181    // Zookeeper
$ lsof -i tcp:9092    // Kafka
----

== Warming up Maven

Now that you have the initial structure in place, navigate to the the root directory and run:

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#


[source,shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

By running this command, it downloads all the required dependencies.

== Warming up Docker

icon:hand-o-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

To warm up your Docker image repository, navigate to the `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes/infrastructure` directory.
Here, you will find a `docker-compose.yaml`/`docker-compose-linux.yaml` files which defines all the needed Docker images.
Notice that there is a `db-init` directory with a `initialize-databases.sql` script which sets up our databases and a `monitoring` directory (all that will be explained later).

[WARNING]
.Linux User
====
If you are on Linux, use `docker-compose-linux.yaml` instead of `docker-compose`.yaml
====

Then execute `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d` or `docker-compose -f docker-compose-linux.yaml up -d` on Linux.
This will download all the Docker images and start the containers.

[WARNING]
====
If you have an issue creating the roles for the database with the `initialize-databases.sql` file, you have to execute the following commands:

```
docker exec -it --user postgres super-database psql -c "CREATE ROLE superman LOGIN PASSWORD 'superman' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION"
docker exec -it --user postgres super-database psql -c "CREATE ROLE superbad LOGIN PASSWORD 'superbad' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION"
docker exec -it --user postgres super-database psql -c "CREATE ROLE superfight LOGIN PASSWORD 'superfight' NOSUPERUSER INHERIT NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOREPLICATION"
```
====

Once all the containers are up and running, you can shut them down with the commands:

[source, shell]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml rm
----

[NOTE]
====
.What's this infra?
Any microservice system is going to rely on a set of technical services.
In our context, we are going to use PostgreSQL as the database, Prometheus as the monitoring tool, and Kafka as the event/message bus.
This infrastructure starts all these services, so you don't have to worry about them.

== Ready?

Prerequisites has been installed, the different components have been warmed up,  it's now time to write some code!
