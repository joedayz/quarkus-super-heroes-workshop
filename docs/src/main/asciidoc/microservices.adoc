[[microservices]]
= One Microservice is no Microservices

'''

So far we've built one microservice.
In the following sections you will develop two extra microservices: a _villain_ microservice, a mad copycat of the _hero_ microservice, and a _fight_ microservice where heroes and villains fight.
We will also add an Angular front-end so we can fight graphically.

Each microservice is developed in it's own directory.
