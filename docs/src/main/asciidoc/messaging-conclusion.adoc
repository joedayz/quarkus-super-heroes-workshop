= Unifying Imperative and Reactive Programming

So, as seen in this chapter, Quarkus is not limited to HTTP microservices, but fits perfectly in an event-driven architecture.
The secret behind this is to use a single reactive engine for both imperative and reactive code:

This unique architecture allows to mix imperative and reactive, but also use the right _model_ for the job.
To go further on this, we recommend:
