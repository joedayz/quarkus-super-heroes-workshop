Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.footnote:[CORS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing]
So when we want our heroes and villains to fight, we actually cross several origins:
we go from localhost:8080 (the UI) to localhost:8082 (Fight API) which invokes localhost:8083 (Hero) and localhost:8084 (Villain).
If you look at the console of your Browser you should see something similar to this:

Quarkus comes with a CORS filter which intercepts all incoming HTTP requests.
It can be enabled in the Quarkus configuration file:

[source,properties]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/rest-hero/src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=adocCORS]
----

If the filter is enabled and an HTTP request is identified as cross-origin, the CORS policy and headers defined using the following properties will be applied before passing the request on to its actual target (servlet, JAX-RS resource, etc.):

[cols="30,70",options="header"]
|===
|Property
|Description

|`quarkus.http.cors.origins`
|The comma-separated list of origins allowed for CORS. The filter allows any origin if this is not set.

|`quarkus.http.cors.methods`
|The comma-separated list of HTTP methods allowed for CORS. The filter allows any method if this is not set.

|`quarkus.http.cors.headers`
|The comma-separated list of HTTP headers allowed for CORS. The filter allows any header if this is not set.

|`quarkus.http.cors.exposed-headers`
|The comma-separated list of HTTP headers exposed in CORS.

|`quarkus.http.cors.access-control-max-age`
|The duration indicating how long the results of a pre-flight request can be cached. This value will be returned in a Access-Control-Max-Age response header.

So make sure you set the `quarkus.http.cors` property to `true` on the:

1. Fight microservice,
2. Hero microservice,
3. Villain microservice

But, even with this, the UI is still not working.
The explanation is simple, we forgot another thing:

[plantuml,align=center]

include::plantuml/fights-sequence.puml[]

Remember the function to retrieve random fighters.
We are currently returning `null`.
Let's move to the next session to see how we can implement this method.
