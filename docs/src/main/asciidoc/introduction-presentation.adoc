= Presenting the Workshop

== What Is This Workshop About?

This workshop should give you a practical introduction to Quarkus.
You will first install all the needed tools to then develop an entire microservice architecture, mixing classical HTTP microservices and event-based microservices.
You will finish by extending the capabilities of Quarkus and learn more about the ability to create native executables.

The idea is that you leave this workshop with a good understanding of what Quarkus is, what it is not, and how it can help you in your projects.
Then, you'll be prepared to investigate a bit more and, hopefully, contribute.

== What Will You Be Developing?

In this workshop you will develop an application that allows super-heroes to fight against villains.
Being a workshop about microservices, you will be developing several microservices communicating either synchronously via REST or asynchronously using Kafka:

* _Super Hero UI_: an Angular application allowing you to pick up a random super-hero, a random villain and makes them fight.
The Super Hero UI is exposed via Quarkus and invokes the Fight REST API
* _Hero REST API_: Allows CRUD operations on Heroes which are stored in a Postgres database
* _Villain REST API_: Allows CRUD operations on Villains which are stored in a Postgres database
* _Fight REST API_: This REST API invokes the Hero and Villain APIs to get a random super-hero and a random villain.
Each fight is stored in a Postgres database
* _Statistics_: Each fight is asynchronously sent (via Kafka) to the Statistics microservice.
It has a HTML + JQuery UI displaying all the statistics.
* _Promotheus_ polls metrics from the three microservices Fight, Hero and Villain

The main UI allows you to pick up one random Hero and Villain by clicking on "New Fighters".
Then it's just a matter of clicking on "Fight!" to get them to fight.
The table at the bottom shows the list of the previous fights.

== How Does This Workshop Work?

You have this material in your hands (either electronically or printed) and you can now follow it step by step.
The structure of this workshop is as follow :

* _Installing all the needed tools_:
in this section you will install all the tools and code to be able to develop, compile and execute our application
* _Developing with Quarkus_:
in this section you will develop a microservice architecture by creating several Maven projects, write some Java code, add JPA entities, JAX-RS REST endpoints, write some tests, use an Angular web application, and all that on Quarkus
* Extending Quarkus:
in this section you will create a Quarkus extension

If you already have the tools installed, skip the _Installing all the needed tools_ section and jump to the sections _Developing with Quarkus_ and _Extending Quarkus_, and start hacking some code and addons.
This "Ã  la carte" mode allows you to make the most of this 6 hours long hands on lab.

== What Do You Have to Do?

This workshop should be as self explanatory as possible.
So your job is to follow the instructions by yourself, do what you are supposed to do, and do not hesitate to ask for any clarification or assistance, that's why the team is here.
Oh, and be ready to have some fun!

== Software Requirements

First of all, make sure you have a 64bits computer with admin rights (so you can install all the needed tools) and at least 8Gb of RAM (as some tools need a few resources).

[WARNING]
====
If you are using Mac OS X make sure the version is greater than 10.11.x (Captain).
====

This workshop will make use of the following software, tools, frameworks that you will need to install and now (more or less) how it works:

* Any IDE you feel comfortable with (eg. Intellij IDEA, Eclipse IDE, VS Code..)
* JDK 8
* GraalVM 19.2.1 or 19.3.1
* Maven 3.6.x
* Docker
* cURL (or any other command line HTTP client)
* Node JS (optional, only if you are in a _frontend_ mood)

The next section focuses on how to install and setup the needed software.
You can skip the next section if you have already installed all the prerequisites.

[WARNING]
====
This workshop assumes a bash shell.
If you run on Windows in particular, adjust the commands accordingly.
