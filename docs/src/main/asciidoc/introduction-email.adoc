= Getting Ready for the Quarkus Workshop

Hi all,

The conference is approaching, and soon we will all be spending a bit of time coding some microservices with Quarkus!
Aren't you excited about it?

But before we start coding, *we want you to install a few tools* so the workshop goes smoothly.
As you will see, the microservice architecture that we will be developing is quite rich in terms of technologies:
We need a few tools installed, repositories to be filled and Docker images to be downloaded.
So please, find attached a PDF document introducing the workshop, and explaining how to install the needed tools.
If you have any problem following this guide, just ping us by email and we will help you.

See you soon.

Emmanuel Bernard, Clement Escoffier, Antonio Goncalves
