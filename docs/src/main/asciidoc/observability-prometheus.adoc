= Displaying Metrics on Prometheus

:icons: font

Now that we've added some load to our application, let's measure it with Prometheus.footnote:[Prometheus https://prometheus.io]
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that integrates well with Quarkus.

== Configuring Prometheus

Prometheus needs to be configured to poll data from our microservices.
This is made under our `infrastructure` directory, in the `prometheus.yml` file:

[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
include::{github-raw}/super-heroes/infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus.yml[tags=adocPrometheus]
----

This file contains basic Prometheus configuration, plus a specific `scrape_config` which instructs Prometheus to look for application metrics from both Prometheus itself, and our Quarkus microservices at the `/metrics` endpoint.

[NOTE]
====
To execute the application we now need Prometheus.
Make sure the infrastructure is up and running.
This means that you've executed `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d`.
====

[NOTE]
.On Linux / Ubuntu
====
On Linux, you may need to update the `localhost` from the `prometheus-linux.yml` file with the IP associated with the `docker0` interface.
Find the address, update the `prometheus-linux.yml` and restart the infrastructure.
Don't forget to restart the microservices to re-populate the databases.
====

== Adding Graphs to Prometheus

The Prometheus console is accessible at http://localhost:9090.

Out of the box, you get a lot of basic JVM metrics or even metrics of Prometheus itself, which are useful.
But let's create new graphs with the metrics of our microservices.

Tape `timeGetRandomHero` in the query, and select `application_io_quarkus_workshop_superheroes_hero_HeroResource_timeGetRandomHero_five_min_rate_per_second` in the box, and click _Execute_.

This will fetch the values from our metric showing the number of checks performed:

Stop the load application before going further.
